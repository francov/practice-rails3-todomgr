README_JASMINE
------------------
BDD framework for testing JavaScript code.
See http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/


Installation
------------------
In the Gemfile:

	group :development, :test do
  		gem "jasminerice"
  		gem "guard-jasmine"
	end

1) 	The first "jasminerice" was used for compliance with the Rails3 asset pipeline.
2) 	The second "guard-jasmine" is for headless testing, from command line. To get Guard up and running you need
	PhantomJS installed on your system.


Usage
------------------
This guide was followed:
	http://blog.blazingcloud.net/2012/03/03/getting-started-with-jasmine-and-rails-3-2/

1)	$> bundle exec guard init jasmine
	In this way when rails server start you can see specs at http://localhost:3000/jasmine

2)	$> bundle exec guard

NOTE: All spec files must end with _spec.js


Tips
------------------
We encountered some problems with async requests, expecially with store load(). A work around was to use a boolean 
variable becoming true on the "load" event fired by an Ext store, eg.:
In the beforeEach:
	load_done = false;
	runs(function(){
		list_store.addListener("load", function() {
	       load_done = true;
		}, this);
	});
	waitsFor(function() { return load_done; }, "load event never fired", 4000);
